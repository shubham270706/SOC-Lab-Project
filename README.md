# SOC Analyst Home Lab Project

This repository documents my journey in building a **SOC (Security Operations Center) Analyst Home Lab**. The project simulates real-world SOC scenarios and includes log collection, threat detection, alerting, and incident response using tools like **Wazuh**, **ELK Stack**, and custom integrations.
