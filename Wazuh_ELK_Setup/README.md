# üõ†Ô∏è Wazuh + ELK Stack Setup

This section documents the installation and configuration of the Wazuh server along with the ELK Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana) for log analysis, monitoring, and visualization.

## üìå Why Combine Wazuh with ELK?

Wazuh acts as a powerful Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) tool when integrated with ELK.  
- **Wazuh** handles log collection, threat detection, and alerting.  
- **Elasticsearch** stores and indexes logs.  
- **Logstash** processes and forwards logs.  
- **Kibana** visualizes alerts and system activity.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Installation Overview

I followed the **official Wazuh documentation** to install and configure Wazuh with the ELK stack. The installer automates most of the process.
